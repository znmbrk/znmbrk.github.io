  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Domora is an AI-powered assistant designed specifically for real estate agents to streamline their workflow and enhance client interactions. The platform automates time-consuming tasks and provides intelligent insights to help agents close more deals efficiently.</p>

  <h2>What does domora do?</h2>

  <p>Domora transforms how real estate agents work by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>automated client communication</strong> - handles initial inquiries, schedules viewings, and sends follow-up messages</li>
    <li><strong>property analysis</strong> - provides instant market comparisons and pricing recommendations</li>
    <li><strong>lead qualification</strong> - intelligently scores and prioritizes potential clients</li>
    <li><strong>document generation</strong> - creates contracts, proposals, and listing materials automatically</li>
    <li><strong>market insights</strong> - delivers real-time data on neighborhood trends and buyer behavior</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>In the beginning...</h2>

  <p>It was an absolute nuts day - I hadn't coded in so long and completely forgot how alive I felt creating something and seeing it come to life. I think I slept for 1 hour at 6am after coding the whole night.</p>

  <p>We were the only team with a live demo and ended up winning the hackathon</p>
