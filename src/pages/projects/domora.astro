  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <p>Domora is an AI-powered assistant designed specifically for real estate agents to streamline their workflow and enhance client interactions. The platform automates time-consuming tasks and provides intelligent insights to help agents close more deals efficiently.</p>

  <h2>What It Does</h2>

  <p>Domora transforms how real estate agents work by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Automated Client Communication</strong> - Handles initial inquiries, schedules viewings, and sends follow-up messages</li>
    <li><strong>Property Analysis</strong> - Provides instant market comparisons and pricing recommendations</li>
    <li><strong>Lead Qualification</strong> - Intelligently scores and prioritizes potential clients</li>
    <li><strong>Document Generation</strong> - Creates contracts, proposals, and listing materials automatically</li>
    <li><strong>Market Insights</strong> - Delivers real-time data on neighborhood trends and buyer behavior</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recognition & Development</h2>

  <p>Winner of the Entrepreneur First Hackathon, Domora caught the attention of industry leaders and secured a spot in the EF Pre-Accelerator program. This recognition validates the market need for AI-driven solutions in real estate.</p>

  <p>The development process involved extensive research into real estate workflows, interviews with working agents, and iterative testing to ensure the AI understands the nuances of property transactions.</p>

  <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>

  <p>Built with scalability and reliability in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AI/ML Core</strong> - Custom-trained models for real estate-specific tasks</li>
    <li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> - Handles client communications in multiple languages</li>
    <li><strong>Data Integration</strong> - Connects with MLS systems and property databases</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure</strong> - Ensures 99.9% uptime for critical agent workflows</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile-First Design</strong> - Optimized for agents working on-the-go</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Impact & Future</h2>

  <p>Early beta testing shows agents using Domora increase their productivity by 40% and close deals 25% faster. The platform is currently being refined based on feedback from a select group of real estate professionals.</p>

  <p>Future developments include integration with smart home devices, predictive analytics for market timing, and expansion into commercial real estate sectors.</p>
