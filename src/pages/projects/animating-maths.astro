  <h1>Animating Maths</h1>
  <p class="author">JavaScript animations showcasing mathematical beauty</p>

  <h2>Project Explanation</h2>

  <p>Mathematics has a profound order and simplicity to it. My aim is to illustrate the beauty of this seemingly daunting subject in a way that highlights how awe-inspiring it can be.</p>

  <p>I produce my animations using JavaScript's p5.js Library. This is a library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists and designers! p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality which I have utilised.</p>

  <h2>Project 1: Fourier Series!</h2>

  <p>A Fourier series is a sum that represents a periodic function as a sum of sine and cosine waves.</p>
