  <h2>Project Explanation</h2>

  <p>Developed a street-fighter game in Python using Object-Oriented Programming and the Pygame library.</p>

  <p>I created a database in SQL to log the user's scores and display the top 5 on the leaderboard. This involved thinking about collision detections and reality-based projectile motion as well as using AI to underpin game difficulty and progression.</p>
