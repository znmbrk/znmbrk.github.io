  <h1>Anything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur</h1>
  <p class="author">by Derek Sivers</p>

  <h2>My Reflections</h2>

  <p>Derek Sivers has a unique way of cutting through business complexity to find simple truths. His experience building CD Baby gives him credibility that many business authors lack.</p>

  <p>What I appreciate most is his focus on serving customers rather than chasing metrics or following conventional wisdom.</p>

  <h2>Key Takeaways So Far</h2>

  <p>• Business success comes from solving real problems for real people</p>
  <p>• Systems and processes should serve people, not the other way around</p>
  <p>• Sometimes the unconventional approach is the right one</p>
  <p>• Building a business is really about building relationships</p>
