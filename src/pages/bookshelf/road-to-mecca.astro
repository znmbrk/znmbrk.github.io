  <h1>Road to Mecca</h1>
  <p class="author">by Muhammad Asad</p>

  <h2>My Reflections</h2>

  <p>Muhammad Asad's journey from European intellectual to Muslim scholar is remarkable. His perspective as someone who came to Islam as an adult brings unique insights.</p>

  <p>The way he describes his travels and spiritual awakening in the early 20th century Middle East feels both historical and deeply personal.</p>

  <h2>Key Takeaways So Far</h2>

  <p>• The importance of approaching new ideas with genuine curiosity rather than preconceptions</p>
  <p>• How travel and exposure to different cultures can fundamentally change our worldview</p>
  <p>• The value of intellectual honesty in spiritual seeking</p>
