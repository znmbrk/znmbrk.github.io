  <h1>The Barakah Effect</h1>
  <p class="author">by Mohammed A Faris</p>

  <h2>My Reflections</h2>

  <p>Still working through this one, but the concept of "barakah" (divine blessing) in productivity and life is fascinating.</p>

  <p>What strikes me most is how it challenges the typical Western approach to productivity by emphasizing spiritual alignment and intention behind our actions.</p>

  <h2>Key Takeaways So Far</h2>

  <p>• Productivity without purpose can lead to spiritual emptiness</p>
  <p>• The quality of our intentions affects the outcomes of our work</p>
  <p>• Balance between worldly achievement and spiritual growth is essential</p>
